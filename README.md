## Issues

I originally wrote this code in Python 2 five years ago, and have not touched most of it since 2013. I'm currently in the middle of updating the code to support Python 3, so expect this project to be full of bugs right now. I would like to resume more active development, but currently I'm busy with college so my time is limited. If you encounter issues, feel free to report them on GitHub.
