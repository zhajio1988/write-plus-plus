	<p><font size=+1><b>Sessions</b></font></p>
	<p>A session is a set of files that you have open in Write++. When you save a session, Write++ also remembers the tab that is currently selected and the first visible line, caret position, and selection for each editor. Write++ automatically saves the active session when you close it, and when you start it again, it will restore all of the files in that session. If you open a second Write++ window, it will not use any session by default, so when you close it, your open files there will not be saved as a session. However, they will be available from the Recent Files menu.</p>
	<p>You can load and save sessions using the corresponding commands on the File menu. So, if you develop two programs, you can have a session for each, and switch back and forth between the two. You can also have one session open in one window, and another session in another window. If you do this, however, remember that after you have closed all of the windows, the session that Write++ will load next time it starts will be the one that belonged to the last window you had open.</p>
